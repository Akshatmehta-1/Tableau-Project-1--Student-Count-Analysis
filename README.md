📊 Student Count Analysis Using Tableau & SQL

A data-driven approach to analyzing student trends and well-being factors using SQL for data transformation and Tableau for visualization.

📌 Project Overview

This project explores the relationship between student count and various influencing factors such as:

📖 Academic Pressure vs Student Count

💰 Financial Stress vs Student Count

💤 Sleep Duration vs Student Count

⏳ Study Hours vs Student Count

😊 Study Satisfaction vs Student Count

Using SQL for data transformation and Tableau for visualization, we derive actionable insights to help educational institutions optimize student success strategies.

🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools

✔ SQL – Data transformation & preprocessing 

✔ Tableau – Data visualization & dashboard creation

✔ Excel– Data storage & input

✔ Statistics & Analysis – Identifying trends and correlations


⚡ Data Transformation with SQL

Before visualization, SQL was used to clean and transform raw student data:

Data Cleaning: Removing duplicates, handling missing values, and standardizing formats.

Feature Engineering: Creating calculated fields like average study hours, stress levels, and satisfaction scores.

Aggregations: Summarizing student count by different parameters for meaningful insights.

Joins & Filtering: Merging datasets and filtering data based on relevant conditions.


📷 Dashboard & Visuals

🔹 The project includes multiple visualizations analyzing student data across different parameters.

🔹 The final interactive dashboard provides deep insights into student trends, well-being, and academic engagement.

📈 Key Insights

🔹 High academic pressure can negatively impact student retention.

🔹 Financial stress plays a crucial role in enrollment and dropout rates.

🔹 Balanced sleep schedules correlate with better academic performance.

🔹 Optimized study hours improve productivity without causing burnout.

🔹 Higher student satisfaction leads to better engagement and lower dropout rates.
